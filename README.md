# RÂ³school/ELIXIR training: High performance scientific computing using Julia

This repository collects the supporting material for the Julia course.

## What should I prepare for the course?

If you want to follow the examples, try the stuff interactively and possibly get feedback to your code, you want to install Julia in advance.

- For session 1, you need just a bare Julia installation (see below)
- For session 2, install Jupyter notebooks (see below).
- For session 3, we will work with distributed computation. If you have a remote computer (e.g. a server) available where you can SSH and run the processes there, you may want to prepare a working SSH connection to it, and install Julia there as well.


## Installing Julia

Installation of Julia is easy, just follow the instructions for your platform here: https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/

TODO: Jupyter installation

## Course materials

- [Slides for session 1 (basics)](TODO)
- [Jupyter notebook for session 2](TODO) ([pre-rendered slides here](TODO))
- [Sample data for session 2](TODO)
- [Slides for session 3 (distributed computing)](TODO)

We will show many small code examples in the Julia interpreter; command history will be published after the course.

## Questions and feedback

Please ask questions anytime during the course.

You are invited to leave course feedback here: https://is.gd/Juliaelixir202104
